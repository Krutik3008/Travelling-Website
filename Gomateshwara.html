                <h1>Gomateshwara</h1>
                <p>Gomateshwara, also known as Bahubali, is a legendary figure
                    and an important Jain pilgrimage site located in the town of
                    Shravanabelagola in the Indian state of Karnataka. The
                    Gomateshwara statue is considered to be one of the largest
                    monolithic statues in the world, and is widely regarded as a
                    masterpiece of Jain art and architecture.</p>
                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>The Gomateshwara statue was commissioned by the Jain ruler
                    Chavundaraya and was carved out of a single block of granite
                    in the 10th century AD. The statue is 57 feet tall and is
                    considered to be one of the most magnificent examples of
                    Jain art and architecture. The statue is also an important
                    symbol of non-violence and spiritualism in Jainism.</p>
                <h2>Symbolism</h2>
                <p>The Gomateshwara statue is an important symbol of Jainism.
                    The statue represents the Jain ideal of ahimsa, or
                    non-violence, as Gomateshwara is shown standing motionless
                    and peaceful, with vines growing around his legs and arms.
                    The statue also represents the Jain concept of detachment
                    from the material world, as Gomateshwara is depicted
                    standing naked without any worldly possessions.</p>
                <h2>Visiting</h2>
                <p>The Gomateshwara statue is open to visitors every day from
                    sunrise to sunset. Visitors are required to climb 614 steps
                    to reach the top of the hill where the statue is located.
                    Along the way, visitors can see a number of other Jain
                    temples and shrines. The best time to visit the Gomateshwara
                    statue is during the Mahamastakabhisheka festival, which is
                    held once every 12 years.</p>
