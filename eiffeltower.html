                <h1>Eiffel Tower</h1>
                <p>The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower located on
                    the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is one of the most
                    famous landmarks in the world and a symbol of Paris and
                    France.</p>
                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>The Eiffel Tower was designed by Gustave Eiffel and built for
                    the 1889 Exposition Universelle, a World's Fair celebrating
                    the centennial of the French Revolution. It was initially
                    intended to be a temporary structure, but it became so
                    popular that it was allowed to remain standing.</p>
                <h2>Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The tower is 324 meters tall, making it one of the
                        tallest structures in the world.</li>
                    <li>The tower has three levels that can be accessed by
                        stairs or elevators. The top level offers panoramic
                        views of Paris.</li>
                    <li>The tower is made of wrought-iron lattice and painted in
                        shades of brown.</li>
                    <li>The tower is lit up at night, creating a beautiful
                        spectacle that can be seen from far away.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Visiting the Eiffel Tower</h2>
