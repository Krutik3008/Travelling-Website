            <h1>Golden Temple</h1>
                <p>The Golden Temple, also known as Sri Harmandir Sahib, is a Sikh gurdwara located in the city of Amritsar, in the Indian state of Punjab. It was built in the 16th century by the fifth Sikh guru, Guru Arjan Dev, and is considered to be the holiest gurdwara of Sikhism.</p>
                <p>The temple is built around a man-made pool, known as the Amrit Sarovar, which is fed by the holy river Ravi. The temple's dome is covered in gold leaf, which gives it its distinctive appearance.</p>
                <p>The temple is open to people of all faiths and serves free meals to thousands of visitors every day, regardless of their religion, caste, or social status. This practice, known as langar, is a hallmark of Sikhism and reflects the Sikh belief in equality and service to others.</p>
